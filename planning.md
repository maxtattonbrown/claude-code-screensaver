## Pre-event (now → Feb 11)

**Topic collection email** (send ~2 weeks before, so around Jan 28)
- Ask attendees: "What's one thing you want to figure out or discuss?"
- Keep it simple — free text, not a long survey
- Cluster similar responses into 4-5 themes

**Open questions:**
- [ ] Do you have attendee emails from Luma, or need to message through platform?
- [ ] How many attendees expected this time?

## On the night — format

**Unconference-lite structure:**
1. **Arrival + mingling** (15-20 min) — drinks, people find their feet
2. **Quick intro from you** (5 min) — explain the format, point to the zones
3. **Session 1** (30-40 min) — four zones running simultaneously
4. **Shuffle/break** (10 min) — people can switch zones
5. **Session 2** (30-40 min) — same or evolved topics
6. **Open networking** (remaining time)

**Zone setup:**
- 4 distinct areas with clear labels (flip chart stands with topic names?)
- Each zone needs a "host" — someone to keep conversation moving (volunteers?)
- Consider a "newbie" zone specifically for people just getting started

**How people choose:**
- Physical movement on arrival — "go stand by the topic you want to discuss"
- Or topic board where people put dots/stickers on what interests them, then call out zone locations
