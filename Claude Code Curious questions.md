# Claude Code Curious Q&A 2


**CoWork** — Shipped SO fast. How are you exploring WHAT to build when anything is possible so quickly? How does something cross the line to "Do it"?

**Data / MCP** — One of the big realisations seems to be: if you get data in open format in one place on your computer, AMAZING THINGS HAPPEN. What is your advice to people to prep their data? Or just MCP?

**Coolest thing** you have seen people do at Anthropic with Claude Code, that people might not be aware of?

**CLI best practices** — What separates good Claude Code users from great ones? What habits or techniques make the biggest difference?

**Fast mode** — How should people think about when to use fast mode vs regular? What workflows benefit most from each?

**Agent swarms** — What patterns are actually working vs falling apart with multi-agent setups? Where does "too many cooks in the kitchen" kick in?

# Q&A 1

**INTERFACE/ EXPERIENCE**
- Obviously desktop and mobile are most peoples' experience but there is a power ceiling. We see hints of agentic e.g Deep Research. But CC is another level. What are your personal thoughts on how you merge that in?
-  **What does the team intentionally NOT build?** Where do you see the line? What do you say no to over and over?
- What would you say NEVER to use Claude Code for?
- I see kind of generative design slipping in in the terminal. How far do you think that can be pushed?

Once you start using Claude Code, it's hard to understand why you'd go back. Isn't it a kind Claude Max/ Pro?

Tell me a Eureka moment you had recently where you learned something useful to get around a challenge.

**SECRET SAUCE**
- Anyone who has tried to build with the Agent SDK knows there’s more going on than it seems — what’s surprisingly important in the way CC is build to making this work.
- 

**TECHNIQUE**
(Magnus) - Is it worth isolating projects in folders or should I just run at the top level of my GitHub folder?

**FUN**
- What is the mascot - a crab??? Squid? Octopus? WHAT.
- what is boris really like?
