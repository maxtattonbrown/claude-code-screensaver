Hi Martine,

Great news — event #2 went really well. About 60 people, good energy, Connor was excellent on the Q&A. People stayed late, which is always the real signal.

**Expenses**

Total came to £669.70:
- Pizza: £475.80
- Drinks: £193.90

I know the sponsorship was ~$1,000 USD, so we're comfortably within that. How would you like me to submit the receipts? Happy to send photos, PDFs, whatever format works for your team.

**Next event**

We've locked in **March 11** at **Granola HQ in Old St**. Different vibe from LocalGlobe — smaller, cosier. I'll share the Luma page once it's up.

**Screensaver**

I built a terminal screensaver for the events — it runs fake Claude Code sessions on a big screen while people are arriving. It's open source and configurable for any Claude Code meetup: https://github.com/maxtattonbrown/claude-code-screensaver

Thought your team might want to use it or share it with other community hosts. It's a fun little touch.

Let me know on the receipts and shout if you need anything else for March.

All the best,
Max
